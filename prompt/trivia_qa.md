Truthfulness: Evidence shows that Prince Henry of Prussia was granted the first German patent for the windshield wiper on March 24, 1908, and supposedly invented the windshield wiper and car horn. However, there is no evidence linking him to spark plug development. The proposed answer is factually incorrect.",
