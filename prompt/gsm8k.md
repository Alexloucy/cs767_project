"question": "Janet hires six employees. Four of them are warehouse workers who make $15/hour, and the other two are managers who make $20/hour. Janet has to pay 10% of her workers' salaries in FICA taxes. If everyone works 25 days a month and 8 hours a day, how much does Janet owe total for their wages and taxes for one month?",
"code": "num*of_warehouse_workers = 4\nnum_of_managers = 2\nwage_of_warehouse_workers = 15\nwage_of_managers = 20\nnum_of_days = 25\nnum_of_hours = 8\ntotal_hours = num_of_days * num*of_hours\ntotal_wage = num_of_warehouse_workers * wage*of_warehouse_workers * total*hours + num_of_managers * wage*of_managers * total*hours\nanswer = total_wage * 1.1",
"execution": "Done",
"output": "22000.0",
"problem": "1. The total wages and taxes should be positive, 22000 > 0, it's reasonable.\n\n2. Let's check the code:\n\n> # Janet hires six employees.

However, there are some improvements that can be made to make the code more concise and easier to read.",
"feedback": "The code is functionally correct and yields a reasonable output. The primary issue highlighted is that its readability and conciseness could be enhanced. For example, the main calculation for `total_wage` is a single long line; breaking it down into more manageable, named intermediate steps, such as calculating wages per employee type first, and explicitly defining the tax calculation could improve clarity.",

"question": "A farmer has twice as many pigs as cows, and 4 more cows than goats. If the farmer has 56 animals total, how many pigs does he have?",
"code": "num_of_pigs = 2 * num*of_cows\nnum_of_cows = number_of_goats + 4\nnum_of_animals = 56\nnumber_of_goats = (num_of_animals - 4) / 3\nnum_of_cows = (number_of_goats + 4) * 2\nanswer = num*of_cows",
"execution": "NameError(\"name 'num_of_cows' is not defined\")",
"output": "None",
"problem": "1. The above code causes the \"NameError\" because it use the variable `num_of_cows` before it is defined.\n\n2. The variable names in the code are a little bit confusing, becase both `num_of_pigs` and \"number_of_goats\" are used.\n\nLet's analysis the problem, we know that the total number of animals are 56, but we don't konw the number of pigs, cows or goats, and we can't get any of them directly, so we can build equations to solve for the number of pigs.",
"feedback": "The code fails to execute due to a \"NameError,\" as it attempts to use the variable `num_of_cows` in the first line before this variable has been assigned a value. Additionally, the problem description notes that inconsistent variable naming (e.g., using both `num_of_pigs` and `number_of_goats` styles) contributes to confusion. The logical order of variable definitions and assignments is incorrect for the problem's dependencies.",

"feedback": "The code produces an illogical negative result (-4.0) for the number of uneaten pizza pieces. The core problem identified is a logical error in calculating the eaten pieces: `num_of_pieces_eaten_by_bill_and_dale = num_of_pieces * 0.5` and `num_of_pieces_eaten_by_ann_and_cate = num_of_pieces * 0.75` incorrectly apply percentages to the total number of pieces from all pizzas combined. The logic should reflect that individuals eat portions of their _own_ pizzas.",

"feedback": "Although the output (48.0) might seem reasonable, the code contains critical logical errors in calculating the cost. The variable `pounds_per_bag` is ambiguously set to 10 and then incorrectly used to calculate `num_of_12_pounds_bag` (which should be based on 12 pounds per bag, not 10). Additionally, the code fails to round up the number of bags needed to the nearest integer, potentially resulting in an insufficient amount of flour being purchased. These errors flaw the overall cost calculation.",
