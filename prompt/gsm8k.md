"question": "Janet hires six employees. Four of them are warehouse workers who make $15/hour, and the other two are managers who make $20/hour.

"problem": "1. Plausibility: Output is positive (22000 > 0), reasonable.\n2. Code check: Correctly calculates total hours, then total wage for all employees (warehouse + managers). Correctly adds 10% tax. Logic is sound, but code could be more readable/concise.",
"feedback": "The code is functionally correct and yields a reasonable output. The primary issue highlighted is that its readability and conciseness could be enhanced. For example, the main calculation for `total_wage` is a single long line; breaking it down into more manageable, named intermediate steps, such as calculating wages per employee type first, and explicitly defining the tax calculation could improve clarity.",

Inconsistent variable naming ('num_of_pigs', 'number_of_goats'). Problem requires setting up equations, not directly calculating values in this order.",
"feedback": "The code fails to execute due to a \"NameError,\" as it attempts to use the variable `num_of_cows` in the first line before this variable has been assigned a value. Additionally, the problem description notes that inconsistent variable naming (e.g., using both `num_of_pigs` and `number_of_goats` styles) contributes to confusion. The logical order of variable definitions and assignments is incorrect for the problem's dependencies.",

"feedback": "The code produces an illogical negative result (-4.0) for the number of uneaten pizza pieces. The core problem identified is a logical error in calculating the eaten pieces: `num_of_pieces_eaten_by_bill_and_dale = num_of_pieces * 0.5`and`num_of_pieces_eaten_by_ann_and_cate = num_of_pieces \* 0.75` incorrectly apply percentages to the total number of pieces from all pizzas combined.

"feedback": "Although the output (48.0) might seem reasonable, the code contains critical logical errors in calculating the cost. The variable `pounds_per_bag` is ambiguously set to 10 and then incorrectly used to calculate `num_of_12_pounds_bag` (which should be based on 12 pounds per bag, not 10). Additionally, the code fails to round up the number of bags needed to the nearest integer, potentially resulting in an insufficient amount of flour being purchased. These errors flaw the overall cost calculation.",
